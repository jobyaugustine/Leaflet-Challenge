# Leaflet Homework: Visualizing Data with Leaflet

Visualization of the Earthquake data.


1. Repository `leaflet-challenge` is created . 

### Level 1: Basic Visualization


1. **The data set**


Earthquake data set is selected from [USGS GeoJSON Feed](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) page.

   
2. **Visualization of the Data**

   A map is created using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from the data set based on their longitude and latitude.

   * Circle Data markers are created to reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and and depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes will be larger and earthquakes with greater depth will be darker in color.

   * Popups are created to provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.

   * Legend is created to display how the marker colors relate with the magnitude of the earthquakes.
